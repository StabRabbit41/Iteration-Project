https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-test-renderer

"This package provides an experimental React renderer that 
can be used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects, 
without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment.

Essentially, this package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the 
"DOM tree" rendered by a React DOM or React Native component without 
using a browser or jsdom."
